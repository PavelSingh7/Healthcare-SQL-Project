## This project focuses on analysing a hospital database using Microsoft SQL Server and looking for the insights that can improve the healthcare services quality.
NOTE - ( This data is totally AI generated with real data reference)
## Also a machine learning classification model is also trained to classify Encounter class of a patient.
